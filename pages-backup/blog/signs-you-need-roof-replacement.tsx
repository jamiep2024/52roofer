            <p className="text-xl text-gray-600">
              Know when it's time to replace your roof rather than repair it
            </p>
          </header>

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
            <h2>1. Age of Your Roof</h2>
            <p>
              Most asphalt shingle roofs last 20-25 years. If your roof is approaching or has exceeded 
              this age, it's time to consider replacement, even if it appears fine from the ground.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Curling or Buckling Shingles</h2>
            <p>
              When shingles begin to curl at the edges or buckle in the middle, it's a clear sign 
              they're past their prime and no longer providing adequate protection.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Missing Shingles</h2>
            <p>
              While a few missing shingles after a storm might only require repairs, extensive 
              missing shingles often indicate a larger problem requiring full replacement.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Granules in Gutters</h2>
            <p>
              Finding large amounts of granules in your gutters, especially if your roof is over 
              10 years old, indicates significant wear and approaching end of life.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Daylight Through Roof Boards</h2>
            <p>
              If you can see daylight coming through your roof boards in the attic, you have 
              serious problems that require immediate attention and likely full replacement.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Sagging Roof Deck</h2>
            <p>
              A sagging roof deck is a serious structural issue that almost always requires 
              complete roof replacement, along with possible structural repairs.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Interior Water Damage</h2>
            <p>
              Water stains on ceilings or walls, especially in the attic, often indicate 
              long-term leaks that may have caused extensive hidden damage.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Rising Energy Bills</h2>
            <p>
              If your energy bills are rising unexpectedly, your roof might be failing to 
              provide proper insulation, often due to water damage or poor ventilation.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Extensive Moss Growth</h2>
            <p>
              While small amounts of moss can be cleaned, extensive moss growth often indicates 
              trapped moisture that may have already damaged the roofing materials beneath.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Multiple Leak Repairs</h2>
            <p>
              If you're frequently repairing leaks, especially in different areas, it's often 
              more cost-effective to replace the entire roof rather than continue with repairs.
            </p>

            <h2>Making the Decision: Repair vs. Replace</h2>
            <p>
              Consider these factors when deciding between repair and replacement:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Age of current roof</li>
              <li>Extent of damage</li>
              <li>Cost comparison of repairs vs. replacement</li>
              <li>Future plans for the property</li>
              <li>Local weather conditions</li>
            </ul>
